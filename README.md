AEM Meetup April 20th 2017
======== 

This is the repository for the trivia component as presented during the
[AEM Meetup of April 20th 2017](https://www.meetup.com/AEM-Developer-Meetup-BE/events/238245647/)

This repository contains 2 branches:
* `master` contains the component with only the classic author dialog. It allows you to play around with the [dialog conversion tool](https://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-2/develop/dev-tools/dialog-conversion.html)
* The `dialog conversion tool` does not handle the html5smartimage widget very well. Manual changes are required to make things work. The `tuidialog` branch contains the Touch UI version of the dialog with the image widget issues fixed.
